# TEN Connect React Components

Welcome to TEN Connect - a comprehensive React component library for integrating with TEN Protocol's privacy-preserving blockchain network.

## What is TEN Protocol?

TEN Protocol is a privacy-focused Ethereum Layer 2 solution that enables confidential smart contracts. Unlike traditional blockchains where all transaction data is public, TEN Protocol ensures that:

- **Transaction Details are Private** - Only the parties involved can see transaction amounts and data
- **Smart Contract State is Confidential** - Contract state is encrypted and only accessible to authorized parties  
- **Front-running Protection** - MEV attacks are prevented through encrypted mempools
- **Regulatory Compliance** - Built-in privacy controls for enterprise adoption

## What is TEN Connect?

TEN Connect is a React component library that makes it easy to build dApps on TEN Protocol. It provides:

### **Wallet Connection**
- Seamless wallet connection with automatic TEN network detection
- Built-in network switching and configuration
- Support for multiple wallet types

### **Session Key Management**
- Privacy-preserving session keys for gasless transactions
- Automatic session key funding and management
- Secure session key deletion with fund recovery

### **Easy Integration**
- Drop-in React components that work out of the box
- Comprehensive TypeScript support
- Zustand-based state management
- Storybook documentation and examples

### **Customizable UI**
- Beautiful default styling with Tailwind CSS
- Fully customizable components
- Dark/light theme support
- Mobile-responsive design

## Key Components

### `WagmiWrapper`
The main provider component that sets up wagmi and React Query for TEN Protocol.

### `ConnectWalletWrapper` 
A wrapper that shows your dApp content only when users are connected to TEN Protocol.

### `ConnectWalletButton`
A smart wallet connection button with built-in network detection and switching.

### `SessionKeyManager`
Complete session key management interface with funding, withdrawal, and deletion capabilities.

### `useSessionKey` Hook
A powerful hook for programmatic session key operations and state management.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install @ten-protocol/connect-react

  SessionKeyManager 
} from '@ten-protocol/connect-react';

function App() {
  return (
    <WagmiWrapper>
      <ConnectWalletWrapper loading={false}>
        <header>
          <h1>My Private dApp</h1>
          <div>
            <SessionKeyManager />
            <ConnectWalletButton />
          </div>
